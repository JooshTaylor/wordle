Idea:
X amount of players join a lobby (100 or so?)
Game starts when 100 players join or 60 seconds after 10 players have joined
When game starts, everyone starts with same random word. 5 minutes to guess it.
Players are eliminated if they fail to guess the word or don't finish in time.
As the rounds go on, the words get harder or longer or the timer gets shorter
At the end of the game, someone is crowned the winner
Game has public leaderboards, friends, unique usernames + logins, statistics, etc
